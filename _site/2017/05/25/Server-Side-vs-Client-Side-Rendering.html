<p>So letâ€™s do it!</p>

<p>I have recently been trying to come up with some initial pointers that could help me with optimization of registration based website at work.</p>

<p>That is when I started reading about the differneces between Server side and client side rendering.</p>

<p>They are basically very simple to understand but it took me a while to get what they really mean and the various ways we could take to go about them.</p>

<p>So, with that intention I decided on writing a small post which will mostly be inclined on explaining the concept. I like to always mention when talking about a technology the following two things;</p>

<ol>
  <li>What it is not?</li>
  <li>What can it be compared two?</li>
  <li>A one liner takeway.</li>
</ol>

<p>This post will not be any different.</p>

<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
