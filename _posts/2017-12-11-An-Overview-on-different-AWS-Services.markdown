Again, like most of my other posts this is mostly targeted to debug the myths and hoopla surrounding new buzz words.

I am going to talk today about different cloud services offered by AWS (Amazon Web Services) which is an Amazon Subsidiary that provides services over the cloud.

Let's start with revising one of the most popular statements made about the cloud.

"Cloud is just someone else's computer". 

A lot of people really hate it as this statement in a way undermines the complexity behing the scenes of cloud services, but for me it makes perfect sense. As a new kid in college with little background in Computer Science, I would get quite confused when my professors would mention about Cloud Engineering or about different Cloud Services available. That statement I believe was the first definition which made sense to me and was simple enough to give me a basic understanding of cloud which I can then use to deep dive into the complicacies behind.

Without further ado, let's get right to it.

| 1     | EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) | Virtual servers                     | Virtual servers that you can use to host your services and applications. And pay by the hour. Before we had cloud ecoystems like AWS and Azure you had Linode, DigitalOcean and Rackspace who would also provide you virtual and dedicated servers.                                                                                       | Azure Virtual Machines                    | Amazon Lightsail, EC2 Container Service, EC2 Container Registry |
| 2     | Lambda                      | Serverless                          | A service that runs your JS, Python, Java code snippets in response to some event or schedule. No need for you to provision any server for this. Cloud provider takes care of that. That is why serverless.                                                                                                                               | Azure Functions                           |                                                                 |
